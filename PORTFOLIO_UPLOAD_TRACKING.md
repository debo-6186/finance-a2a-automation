# Portfolio Upload Status Tracking Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds functionality to track when a portfolio statement has been uploaded and processed in a user session. When the `read_portfolio_statement()` function is called successfully, it marks the `portfolio_statement_uploaded` field as `true` in the database for that session.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Changes

#### File: `init.sql`
- Added `portfolio_statement_uploaded BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE` column to `conversation_sessions` table

#### File: `host_agent/database.py`  
- Added `portfolio_statement_uploaded` field to `ConversationSession` SQLAlchemy model
- Added `mark_portfolio_statement_uploaded()` function to update the field in the database

#### File: `host_agent/migrate_portfolio_field.sql` (NEW)
- Migration script to add the new column to existing databases

### 2. StockReport Analyser Agent Changes

#### File: `stockreport_analyser_agent/agent.py`
- Modified `read_portfolio_statement()` function to accept optional `session_id` parameter
- Added database import and connection logic
- Added code to call `mark_portfolio_statement_uploaded()` when PDF is successfully processed
- Updated agent instructions to extract session ID from user messages
- Updated error handling documentation

### 3. Host Agent Changes

#### File: `host_agent/host/agent.py`
- Added `current_session_id` instance variable to store the current session ID
- Modified `stream()` method to store session ID when processing requests  
- Updated `send_message()` function to replace `[current_session_id]` placeholder with actual session ID
- Updated agent instructions to include session ID in messages to stockreport_analyser_agent

## How It Works

### Workflow:
1. User sends a message requesting portfolio analysis
2. Host agent processes the request and stores the current session ID
3. Host agent sends message to stockreport_analyser_agent with format: "Please analyze the portfolio statement. Session ID: {session_id}"
4. StockReport analyser agent extracts session ID from the message
5. When `read_portfolio_statement(session_id)` is called, it:
   - Reads and processes the PDF file
   - If successful, calls database function to mark `portfolio_statement_uploaded = true`
   - Returns the extracted text

### Database Updates:
- The `mark_portfolio_statement_uploaded()` function updates the specific session record
- Only updates if the session exists and is active
- Logs success/failure for monitoring

## Database Migration
To apply changes to existing databases, run:
```sql
-- Add to existing conversation_sessions table
ALTER TABLE conversation_sessions 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS portfolio_statement_uploaded BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE;
```

## Usage Example
```python
# The session will be automatically marked when portfolio is processed
session_id = "some-session-id"
result = read_portfolio_statement(session_id)
# Database will now show portfolio_statement_uploaded = true for this session
```

## Error Handling
- If database connection fails, the error is logged but doesn't prevent PDF processing
- If session ID is not provided or empty, database update is skipped  
- Import errors for database functions are handled gracefully with warnings

## Monitoring
- All database operations are logged with appropriate info/error messages
- Success/failure of marking portfolio upload status is logged
- PDF processing statistics are logged independently

## Testing
- Syntax validation completed for all modified files
- Database function import tested successfully
- Migration script created for existing databases
