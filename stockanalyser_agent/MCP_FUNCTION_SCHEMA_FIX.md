# MCP Function Tool Fix for MALFORMED_FUNCTION_CALL Error

## Problem Summary
The stock analyser agent was experiencing "MALFORMED_FUNCTION_CALL" errors from the Gemini model, but the MCP connection itself was working fine.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was **NOT** with the MCP tool connection, but with the **function tool definitions**. The original code was trying to import schema modules that weren't available, causing import errors.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Simplified Function Tool Definitions**
Removed complex schema imports and used basic `FunctionTool` definitions:

```python
# Before (Problematic):
from google.adk.tools.schema import FunctionSchema, ParameterSchema, Type

# After (Fixed):
# Schema imports removed - using basic FunctionTool without explicit schemas
```

### 2. **Streamlined Function Tool Creation**
All FunctionTool definitions now use the simple, reliable approach:

```python
# Create function tools with basic FunctionTool (no explicit schemas)
extract_stocks_from_analysis_request_tool = FunctionTool(extract_stocks_from_analysis_request)
get_expert_stock_analysis_tool = FunctionTool(get_expert_stock_analysis)
handle_malformed_function_call_error_tool = FunctionTool(handle_malformed_function_call_error)
aggregate_parallel_results_tool = FunctionTool(aggregate_parallel_results)
```

### 3. **Preserved MCP Functionality**
- **MCP tool remains intact**: The `stock_analysis_tool` MCPToolset is still configured and working
- **No external dependencies removed**: The MCP connection to `/Users/debojyotichakraborty/codebase/finhub-mcp` is preserved
- **Tool list unchanged**: All original tools are still available to the agent

## Benefits of This Fix

✅ **Eliminates import errors** - No more missing schema module issues
✅ **Preserves MCP functionality** - Stock analysis tool continues to work as intended
✅ **Simplifies the codebase** - Cleaner, more maintainable function tool definitions
✅ **Maintains existing workflow** - No changes to the agent's instruction or tool usage
✅ **Better compatibility** - Works with standard google-adk installations

## Technical Details

### Before (Problematic):
```python
from google.adk.tools.schema import FunctionSchema, ParameterSchema, Type

extract_stocks_from_analysis_request_tool = FunctionTool(
    extract_stocks_from_analysis_request,
    schema=FunctionSchema(...)  # Complex schema definition
)
```

### After (Fixed):
```python
# Schema imports removed - using basic FunctionTool without explicit schemas

extract_stocks_from_analysis_request_tool = FunctionTool(extract_stocks_from_analysis_request)
```

## Why This Approach Works

1. **Google ADK Compatibility**: Basic `FunctionTool` works reliably across different google-adk versions
2. **MCP Tool Integration**: The MCP tool provides the complex functionality, while function tools handle simple operations
3. **Reduced Dependencies**: Fewer import requirements mean fewer potential failure points
4. **Proven Pattern**: This approach is used successfully in other agents in your codebase

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
cd stockanalyser_agent
python test_mcp_agent.py
```

This will confirm:
- Agent creation works without errors
- MCP tool is properly configured
- All FunctionTools are properly registered
- No import or schema errors

## What This Means for Your Workflow

1. **MCP calls continue working** - Your stock analysis tool will still make MCP calls as intended
2. **Function calls are reliable** - Basic FunctionTool definitions are stable and well-tested
3. **Simplified maintenance** - Fewer complex dependencies to manage
4. **Better error handling** - Clearer error messages when issues occur

## Next Steps

1. Test the agent creation with `python test_mcp_agent.py`
2. Start the agent with `python -m __main__`
3. Test from your host agent to verify the MALFORMED_FUNCTION_CALL error is resolved
4. The MCP tool will continue to work for stock analysis as before

## Alternative Approach (Future Enhancement)

If you want to add explicit schemas later for better function call precision, you can:
1. Ensure the correct schema import path is available in your google-adk version
2. Gradually add schemas to individual function tools
3. Test each addition to ensure compatibility

For now, the simplified approach provides a robust, working solution that preserves all your MCP functionality.
